<p>Welcome to the Veny blog ‚Äî where we explore object-oriented methodology, domain modeling, and the design of a new language built around these core ideas.</p>

<p>Veny is not just another general-purpose language with object-oriented features bolted on. It is designed from the ground up to treat objects as <strong>modeling units</strong>, where state is local, behavior is owned, and communication happens via messaging.</p>

<h2 id="why-veny">Why Veny?</h2>

<p>Modern programming languages often blur paradigms. They mix procedural, functional, and object-oriented constructs into a single toolkit. While this can be convenient, it also creates confusion about <em>how</em> to model software, especially as systems grow in complexity.</p>

<p>Veny takes a different stance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Objects own their state</strong> (no accidental globals)</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior is explicit</strong> (via message passing)</li>
  <li><strong>Modeling comes first</strong> (code follows domain structure)</li>
</ul>

<p>We call this architectural shift <strong>Inversion of State</strong> (IoS) ‚Äî where global state is broken into encapsulated local state, manipulated only through well-defined object interactions. Similar to how <em>Inversion of Control</em> reshaped frameworks, <em>Inversion of State</em> reshapes how we think about structure and change in codebases.</p>

<p>This blog will be home to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Object-oriented methodology topics</li>
  <li>Examples of real-world modeling in Veny</li>
  <li>Language design discussions</li>
  <li>Comparisons with other OO languages (Smalltalk, Eiffel, Scala, etc.)</li>
  <li>Announcements and roadmap updates</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe that software should be modeled like the real world ‚Äî with <strong>responsibility</strong>, <strong>encapsulation</strong>, and <strong>communication</strong> ‚Äî we invite you to follow along, contribute, and help shape the future of Veny.</p>
