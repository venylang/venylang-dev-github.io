> *"Model before you code. Invert state. Own behavior."*

Welcome to the Veny blog â€” where we explore object-oriented methodology, domain modeling, and the design of a new language built around these core ideas.

Veny is not just another general-purpose language with object-oriented features bolted on. It is designed from the ground up to treat objects as **modeling units**, where state is local, behavior is owned, and communication happens via messaging.

## Why Veny?

Modern programming languages often blur paradigms. They mix procedural, functional, and object-oriented constructs into a single toolkit. While this can be convenient, it also creates confusion about *how* to model software, especially as systems grow in complexity.

Veny takes a different stance:

- **Objects own their state** (no accidental globals)
- **Behavior is explicit** (via message passing)
- **Modeling comes first** (code follows domain structure)

We call this architectural shift **Inversion of State** (IoS) â€” where global state is broken into encapsulated local state, manipulated only through well-defined object interactions. Similar to how *Inversion of Control* reshaped frameworks, *Inversion of State* reshapes how we think about structure and change in codebases.

## Whatâ€™s Coming Next

This blog will be home to:

- Object-oriented methodology topics
- Examples of real-world modeling in Veny
- Language design discussions
- Comparisons with other OO languages (Smalltalk, Eiffel, Scala, etc.)
- Announcements and roadmap updates

If you believe that software should be modeled like the real world â€” with **responsibility**, **encapsulation**, and **communication** â€” we invite you to follow along, contribute, and help shape the future of Veny.
