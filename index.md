# Model Before You Code. Invert State. Own Behavior.

Veny is a modern, pure object-oriented programming language focused on clarity, composability, and real-world domain modeling.

Whether you're building software systems, teaching OO principles, or exploring modern language design, Veny helps you focus on modeling your domain â€” not managing complexity.

## Highlights

- âœ… Pure OO: no global state or free functions
- ðŸ“¦ Clear object encapsulation and messaging
- ðŸ’¡ Inspired by Smalltalk, Java, Kotlin, and Go
- ðŸ§  Designed for learning, tooling, and production use
